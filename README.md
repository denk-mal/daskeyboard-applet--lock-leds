# Lock Key

Displays the state of the Caps Lock, Num Lock or Scroll Lock key state.

**POC (Proof of Concept); Only Linux (sorry for now)**

This is ... Guess what?
Exactly, a 'Das Keyboard Q' plugin to change the color of the 'Caps Lock',
'Num Lock' or the 'Scroll Lock' key. While there is no common way to check the
state of the keys in javascript I have used an external command. Maybe the guys
of DasKeyboard implementing an API function Call to get those state from the
keyboard.
